# Social Engineering

## Objective
- **Objective:** The primary objective of the Social Engineering activity is to assess the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, including phishing, smishing, vishing, and other deceptive techniques.

## Social Engineering Techniques
- **Phishing:**
   - *Description:* Explain how phishing emails are used to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information.
   - *Example:** Provide an example of a phishing email template used during the test.
   
- **Smishing (SMS Phishing):**
   - *Description:* Describe how smishing involves deceptive text messages to manipulate recipients.
   - *Example:** Provide an example of a smishing text message used during the test.

- **Vishing (Voice Phishing):**
   - *Description:* Explain how vishing employs voice calls to extract sensitive information.
   - *Example:** Provide an example of a vishing call script used during the test.

- **Impersonation:**
   - *Description:** Describe how impersonation is used to deceive individuals by posing as someone they trust.
   - *Example:** Provide an example of an impersonation scenario used during the test.

## Social Engineering Assessment
- **Targeted Individuals:** List the individuals or departments that were targeted during the social engineering assessment.
- **Methods and Techniques:** Detail the specific methods and techniques used in each social engineering attack.
- **Data Gathered:** Summarize the information acquired through social engineering attacks, such as usernames, passwords, or sensitive data.

## Social Engineering Table (Example)
Use the following table to document social engineering attacks and their outcomes:

| Attack Type | Targeted Individual | Method/Technique | Outcome | Recommendations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phishing | Employee A | Deceptive email with a fake login link | Gathered login credentials | Conduct security awareness training. |
| Smishing | Employee B | Fraudulent text message with a link | Attempt to steal personal information | Educate users about smishing risks. |
| Vishing | Employee C | Voice call impersonating IT support | Revealed network access details | Reinforce security awareness on vishing. |
| Impersonation | Employee D | Posing as an executive for sensitive data | Confidential information disclosed | Improve identity verification processes. |

## Reporting and Recommendations
- **Social Engineering Report:** Describe the format and content of the social engineering report, including details on how attack scenarios and outcomes are documented.
- **Recommendations:** Explain the process of providing recommendations for enhancing social engineering awareness and security measures.
