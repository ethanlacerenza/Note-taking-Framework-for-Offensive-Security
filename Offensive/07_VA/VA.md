# Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective
- **Objective:** The primary goal of the Vulnerability Assessment activity is to identify and assess vulnerabilities within the target systems and applications.

## Vulnerability Assessment Process
- **Scanning and Discovery:** Describe how the scanning tools and techniques are used to discover potential vulnerabilities.
- **Assessment and Categorization:** Explain how vulnerabilities are assessed and categorized based on their severity and potential impact.
- **Reporting:** Outline the process of reporting and documenting identified vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Assessment Tools
- **List of Tools:** Provide a list of the tools and software used during the Vulnerability Assessment, including vulnerability scanners, such as Nessus or OpenVAS.

## Vulnerability Assessment Table (Example)
Use the following table to document identified vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability ID | Vulnerability Name | Description | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | SQL Injection | A security vulnerability in the database that allows unauthorized access. | High | Patch the application and validate input. |
| 002 | Weak Passwords | Weak passwords found in the system. | Medium | Enforce stronger password policies. |
| 003 | Outdated Software | Software with known security vulnerabilities. | High | Apply patches and updates. |
| 004 | Missing Firewall Rules | Inadequate firewall rules exposing services. | Medium | Adjust firewall rules to restrict access. |

## Vulnerability Classification
- **Critical Vulnerabilities:** Describe how critical vulnerabilities are defined, and their potential impact on the target environment.
- **High-Risk Vulnerabilities:** Explain the significance of high-risk vulnerabilities and the impact they can have on security.
- **Medium and Low-Risk Vulnerabilities:** Define how medium and low-risk vulnerabilities are assessed and categorized.

## Reporting and Recommendations
- **Vulnerability Report:** Describe the format and content of the vulnerability report, including details on how vulnerabilities are documented.
- **Recommendations:** Explain the process of providing recommendations for mitigating and addressing identified vulnerabilities.
